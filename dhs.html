            <p>We are responsible for the development of service delivery policy and provide access to social, health
                and other payments and services.</p>

            <p>On 26 October 2004, we were created as part of the Finance and Administration portfolio. The Human
                Services Legislation Amendment Act 2011 integrated Medicare Australia and Centrelink into the Department
                of Human Services on 1 July 2011

            <p>We work closely with Australian Hearing in providing strategic advice to the Minister and Secretary on
                service delivery policy and regulatory requirements for services delivered under the Australian
                Government Hearing Services Program.

            <h1>Payments and services</h1>
            <p>We offer a range of health, social and welfare payments and services through the following programs:

            <h1>Medicare</h1>
            <p>Looks after the health of Australians through programs such as the:

            <p>Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme
            <p>Australian Immunisation Register and
            <p>Australian Organ Donor Register
            <h1>Centrelink</h1>
            <p>Delivers payments and services and provides services at times of major change for:

            <ul>
                <li>seniors</li>
                <li>job seekers</li>
                <li>students and trainees</li>
                <li>families</li>
                <li>carers</li>
                <li>parents</li>
                <li>people with disability</li>
                <li>Indigenous Australians, and</li>
                <li>people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Child Support</h1>
            <p>Gives separated parents the financial and emotional support needed for their children’s wellbeing. Read more

            <p>Luke? Luke? Luke? Have you seen Luke this morning? He said he had some things to do before he started
                today, so he left early. Uh? Did he take those two new droids with him? I think so. Well, he'd better
                have those units in the south range repaired be midday or there'll be hell to pay! Wait, there's
                something dead ahead on the scanner. It looks like our droid...hit the accelerator.</p>

            <p>Run, Luke! Run!</p>

            <p>He is here... Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think so? A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was
                in the presence of my old master. Surely he must be dead by now. Don't underestimate the power of the
                Force. The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that's
                left of their religion. Yes. Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention block A
                A-twenty-three. The princess! Put all sections on alert!</p>

            <p>He says he's found the main computer to power the tractor beam that's holding the ship here. He'll try to
                make the precise location appear on the monitor. The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in
                seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave. I don't think you
                boys can help. I must go alone. Whatever you say. I've done more that I bargained for on this trip
                already. Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids. But he can...</p>

            <p>Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure.. Don't call me a
                mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! Now come out before somebody sees you. Secret
                mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there! I'm going to regret this.
                There goes another one. Hold your fire. There are no life forms. It must have been short-circuited.
                That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here. Are you sure this things safe?</p>
